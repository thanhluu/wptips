# How to submit your tip

To submit a tip to the list, fork the repository and add your tip in a new file in the correct folder. The name of the file should be `2016-xx-xx-name-of-your-tip`.

### Requirements
- The tip should be readable in less than two minutes
- Adding links to other sites or videos that give more insight is welcome
- Mark code with ``
- Don't mention "WordPress" in the title (as our tips are about it anyway)
- Use backticks (`) to mark code in the **title** and/or **tip-tldr** fields. _Warning_: Both values must not start with backticks!

Once your tip is ready, [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with this [PR template](https://github.com/thanhluu/wptips/blob/gh-pages/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and your tip will be reviewed (see below).

# Notes

Leave the date and the tip number as **xx**. When the PR is `ready to merge`, we will tell you the correct numbers. Please also [squash](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git) your commits.

# Tip flow

**Tip proposal** ⇒ **Tip under review** ⇒ **Tip ready to merge**

- When you send a tip, it has to pass the review process and while that happens, its status is `under review`.
- After the tip had been reviewed by 5 people and they have given their ship it emote (:shipit:), the tip is `ready to merge`.


We are looking forward to your contribution!
